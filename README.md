*Database Project - Introduction to Database Course - University of Jeddah*

This project was developed as part of the **Introduction to Database** course at the University of Jeddah.  
It is designed to support **charitable organizations** in tracking annual donations, managing donors and recipients, and enhancing transparency in fund handling.

## Project Description

Charitable organizations often face challenges such as:

- Lack of transparency in donation management  
- Difficulty generating reports for donors  
- Mismanagement of funds  
- Inability to track recurring support or campaign effectiveness  

This project addresses these issues by implementing a **structured relational database system**.

## Database Design

The system models a **normalized relational schema** that includes the following entities:

- **Donor**  
- **Donation**  
- **Recipient**  
- **Campaign**  
- **Grant**  
- **Delivery**  
- **Broker** (for campaign management)  

Each entity is designed with relevant attributes, such as:

- Personal information  
- Donation type and value  
- Eligibility criteria  
- Campaign goals  
- Delivery tracking  
- Recurring donation support
